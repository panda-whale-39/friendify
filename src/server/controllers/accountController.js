Get Matches Algorithm
- Input: logged in user, logged in user's match preference number, array of all other users

- In order to get matches for a particular user we must: 
- 1. Iterate through the users that aren't our current logged in user
- 2. For every one of those users we must iterate through our logged in user's list of top songs/artists and see if our current iteration's user's topsongs/artists include our song
- 3. keep track of how many songs match
- 4. Push users into our matches array based on both our logged in user's match preference and our comparison user's match preference
- 5. Return that array to the front end
- Output: Array of matches

Get Matches Middleware

- 3. We also are able to access their match preference (metric used to find match based on how many common songs/artists you want your match to like)
- 4. Need to grab an array of all other accounts that aren't the current account we are logged into
- 5. Compare all other accounts against our current user to get matches for our user
- 6. Save our matches array to a locals variable (this is what will be returned to the front end)
