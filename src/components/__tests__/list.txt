setup/teardown: should we worry about this?

TESTS FOR LOGIN.JSX:
    DISPLAY
        test whether "email" and "password" fields have correct texts
        
    DATA FETCHING:
        make dummy api data to test requests
        test axios post request route (to server)
        does "sendToServer" body contain the correct data?

    LISTENERS
        does form button event listener call a function?
        does form button send data from state?
        does changing email text field change the state?
        does changing password text field change the state?
